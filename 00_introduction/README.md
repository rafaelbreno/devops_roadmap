## Introduction
### Try Go
- If you just want to see how Go works, etc.
- [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/) is perfect for you, just an online editor and compiler, perfect for it
### What's this?
- This is a personal project, with a goal to document my learning curve
- Showing and writing everything from my point of view
- Started studying Go from the beginning of the documentation and still learning more everyday
### Who are you?
- Who am I? Tricky question, well, I'm Rafael Breno, a 21y self-taught programmer
- Started with PHP in 2015 when I was 15~16y, but later when I was 20 I meet Go, that instantly caught my attention and I started studying it everyday
- Since May/2020 I've been studying whenever I can, and documenting everything that I learn
### What am I going to learn?
- I don't know, that question isn't for me, you should know the answer
- This repo only stores my learning curve, if you're going to use it as a roadmap, course, or just a forgotten starred repo, it's your responsability
- Maybe, **maybe** this can help you learn how to search documentations and examples

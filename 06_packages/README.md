#### Packages
- This section will be a pretty continuously section, because here I'll be studying new Go packages
- _Why?_ Because if you want to learn something new you need to study it by the Official Docs, you need to _learn how to read and absorve the official docs_.
- _"Where can I find a package?"_
    - Easy, just go to the [Official Package Page](https://golang.org/pkg/)
    - Now just `CTRL + F` to search the keywords of a package you'd need(_'json', 'http', 'math', 'log', 'test', [...]_)

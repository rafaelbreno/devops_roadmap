# DevOps Roadmap
## Introduction
- The purpose of this repo is to help me track my evolution in:
    - DevOps
    - Go Lang
- To help me find a "north" I'm going to use as a *Guide* the site [RoadMap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
- During this long process I'm will be documenting all topics, details, tips, **everything**
- So this maybe(focus on **MAYBE**) can be a "guide" to you

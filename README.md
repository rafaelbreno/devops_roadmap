## Introduction
- The purpose of this repo is to help me track my evolution in:
    - DevOps
    - Go Lang
- To help me find a "north" I'm going to use as a *Guide* the site [RoadMap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
- During this long process I'm will be documenting all topics, details, tips, **everything**
- So this maybe(focus on **MAYBE**) can be a "guide" to you too
## Go Lang
- Like I've said above, I'm going to use GoLang to accompany me go through this learning process
- If you have never heard of *Go* before, this links may help you understand:
    - [Official Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)
    - [Is Go OOP?](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language) <small><small>no and yes ???</small></small>
    - [Principles](https://golang.org/doc/faq#principles)
    - A special thanks to *Ellen K√∂rbes*, for bringing an amazing GOLang content to Brazil in PT-BR
        - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes) || [GOLang Playlist<small>(in pt-br)</small>](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCKpcjBB_VlBsxJ9IseNxFllf-UFEXOdg)
- I'm using for IDE [GOLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
- And a pretty good alternative is [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/), an online IDE
- With everything setup, we're ready to start programming, Let's *GO*!!!

# DevOps Roadmap
## Introduction
- The purpose of this repo is to help me track my evolution in:
    - DevOps
    - Go Lang
- To help me find a "north" I'm going to use as a *Guide* the site [RoadMap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
- During this long process I'm will be documenting all topics, details, tips, **everything**
- So this maybe(focus on **MAYBE**) can be a "guide" to you
## Go Lang
- Like I've said above, I'm going to use GoLang to accompany me go through this learning process
- If you have never heard of *Go* before, this links may help you understand:
    - [Official Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)
    - [Is Go OOP?](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language) <small>no</small>
    - [Principles](https://golang.org/doc/faq#principles)

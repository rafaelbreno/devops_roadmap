#### Struct 02
- In this section I want to approach the struct and interfaces in a more depth way
- In the first chapter studying it ([_Structs_](https://github.com/rafaelbreno/go4noobs/tree/master/03_data_structures/07_struct) ) I felt that it was good enough for that moment
- Now I guess it's a better moment to try to improve it
- Using to create a more "applicable" example
##### Description
- Create a query builder
- Simple SQL
    - Inspired by [Laravel's Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queries)
    - I'm not rebuilding it, just little-mini-macro-nano-simplier version of it 
- Doesn't need to connect to a DB
- Showing the Query is enough
##### _main.go_
